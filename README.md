# Godot-Neural-Network-Genetic-Algorithm
Implementation of neural network and genetic algorithm in godot game engine with C#.

Type of implemented neural network:
1. Feed Forward Neural Network
2. Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network

# Evolution Algorithm
I am using genetic algorithm strategy to optimize neural network.

Note that this project is just for a prototype.
Feel free to fork and optimize it in your suits.

# TODO:
1. Implementing a saving strategy to save models.
